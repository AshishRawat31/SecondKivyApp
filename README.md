# SecondKivyApp

A simple Username/Password page.
>When the program is run it will return a window with widgets of username and password.
>Try re-sizing the window and you will see that the widget on screen adjust themselves according to the size of the window without you having to do anything. This is because widgets use size hinting by default.
>The code doesn't handle the input from the user, does no validation or anything else.
